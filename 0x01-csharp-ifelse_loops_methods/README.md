## Learning Objectives:bulb:
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
- How to use if, else if, else statements
- How to use while and for loops
- How to use break and continue statements
- How to use numeric format strings
- How to declare methods within a class
- How to call public methods from another class
- What is passing by reference and passing by value

### [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative)
* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

  - You can find the source code here
  - The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
  - You don’t have to understand what Random does. Please do not touch this code
  - The output of the program should be:
    * The number, followed by
      - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
      - if the number is 0: is zero
      - if the number is less than 0: is negative
    * followed by a new line

### [1. The last digit](./1-last_digit)
* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

  - You can find the source code here
  - The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
  - You don’t have to understand what Random does. Please do not touch this code
  - The output of the program should be:
    * The string The last digit of, followed by
    * the number, followed by
    * the string is, followed by
      - if the last digit is greater than 5: the digit and is greater than 5
      - if the last digit is 0: the digit and is 0
      - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the digit and is less than 6 and not 0
    * followed by a new line
